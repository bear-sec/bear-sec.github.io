---

This post will be focusing on the "Hideout" challenges presented in picoCTF. These challenges were classified as "General skills". 
All the resources for these challenges, including most of the files, you can find in [my repository](https://github.com/bear-sec/pico2018 "picoCTF2018 writeups").
Lets get in the action.

# General Warmup 1

    1. Submit your answer in our competition's flag format. For example, if you answer was 'hello', you would submit {% raw %}'picoCTF{hello}'{% endraw %} as the flag.
</details>

## Solution

Easy one, basic hexadecimal-to-ascii conversion. 
python:
```python
  print {% raw %}"picoCTF{%c}"{% endraw %} % 0x41
```

# General Warmup 2

Can you convert the number 27 (base 10) to binary (base 2)?

    1. Submit your answer in our competition's flag format. For example, if you answer was '11111', you would submit {% raw %}'picoCTF{11111}'{% endraw %} as the flag.
</details>

## Solution

Simple base conversion:
python:
```python
  print "picoCTF{%s}" % bin(27)[2:]
```

# General Warmup 3

What is 0x3D (base 16) in decimal (base 10).

<details>
  <summary>Hints</summary>
  
    1. Submit your answer in our competition's flag format. For example, if you answer was '22', you would submit {% raw %}'picoCTF{22}'{% endraw %} as the flag.
</details>

## Solution

Simple base conversion again:
python:
```python
  print "picoCTF{%d}" % 0x3d
```
