This post will be focusing on the "Hideout" challenges presented in picoCTF. These challenges were classified as "General skills". 
All the resources for these challenges, including most of the files, you can find in [my repository](https://github.com/bear-sec/pico2018 "picoCTF2018 writeups").
Lets get in the action.

    1. Submit your answer in our competition's flag format. For example, if you answer was 'hello', you would submit {% raw %}'picoCTF{hello}'{% endraw %} as the flag.
</details>

## Solution

Easy one, basic hexadecimal-to-ascii conversion. 
python:
```python
  print {% raw %}"picoCTF{%c}"{% endraw %} % 0x41
```

## Solution

Simple base conversion:
python:
```python
  print {% raw %}"picoCTF{%s}"{% endraw %} % bin(27)[2:]
```

Simple base conversion again:
python:
```python
  print {% raw %}"picoCTF{%d}"{% endraw %} % 0x3d
```

# Resources

We put together a bunch of resources to help you out on our website! If you go over there, you might even find a flag! https://picoctf.com/resources

## Solution

No hints for this one, but we dont need them anyway, cause we just scroll down the page, and see the flag:
picoCTF{xiexie_ni_lai_zheli}

----

# grep1

Can you find the flag in [file 1](https://github.com/bear-sec/pico2018/blob/master/Hideout/5%20-%20grep1/file "File1") ? This would be really obnoxious to look through by hand, see if you can find a faster way. You can also find the file in /problems/grep-1_1_35b9930ca897512a4d00b43d26eac73d on the shell server

<details>
  <summary>Hints</summary>

# Strings

Can you find the flag in this [file1](https://github.com/bear-sec/pico2018/blob/master/Hideout/7%20-%20strings/strings?raw=true)  without actually running it? You can also find the file in /problems/strings_0_bf57524acf558aca2081eb97ece8e2ee on the shell server.

<details>
  <summary>Hints</summary>
  
    1. strings (strings man page)

## Solution

The challenge suggests to use strings command but again, searching in Notepad++ gives the result as well.
