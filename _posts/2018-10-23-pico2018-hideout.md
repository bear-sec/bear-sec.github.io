title: PicoCTF 2018 - Hideout
---

This post will be focusing on the "Hideout" challenges presented in picoCTF. These challenges were classified as "General skills". 
All the resources for these challenges, including most of the files, you can find in [my repository](https://github.com/bear-sec/pico2018 "picoCTF2018 writeups").
Lets get in the action.

# General Warmup 1

If I told you your grade was 0x41 in hexadecimal, what would it be in ASCII?

<details>
  <summary>Hints</summary>
  
    1. Submit your answer in our competition's flag format. For example, if you answer was 'hello', you would submit {% raw %}'picoCTF{hello}'{% endraw %} as the flag.
</details>

## Solution

Easy one, basic hexadecimal-to-ascii conversion. 
python:
```python
  print {% raw %}"picoCTF{%c}"{% endraw %} % 0x41
```
----

# General Warmup 2

Can you convert the number 27 (base 10) to binary (base 2)? 

<details>
  <summary>Hints</summary>
  
    1. Submit your answer in our competition's flag format. For example, if you answer was '11111', you would submit {% raw %}'picoCTF{11111}'{% endraw %} as the flag.
</details>

## Solution

Simple base conversion:
python:
```python
  print {% raw %}"picoCTF{%s}"{% endraw %} % bin(27)[2:]
```
----

# General Warmup 3

What is 0x3D (base 16) in decimal (base 10).

<details>
  <summary>Hints</summary>
  
    1. Submit your answer in our competition's flag format. For example, if you answer was '22', you would submit {% raw %}'picoCTF{22}'{% endraw %} as the flag.
</details>

## Solution

Simple base conversion again:
python:
```python
  print {% raw %}"picoCTF{%d}"{% endraw %} % 0x3d
```

# Resources

We put together a bunch of resources to help you out on our website! If you go over there, you might even find a flag! https://picoctf.com/resources

## Solution

No hints for this one, but we dont need them anyway, cause we just scroll down the page, and see the flag:
picoCTF{xiexie_ni_lai_zheli}

----

# grep1

Can you find the flag in [file 1](https://github.com/bear-sec/pico2018/blob/master/Hideout/5%20-%20grep1/file "File1") ? This would be really obnoxious to look through by hand, see if you can find a faster way. You can also find the file in /problems/grep-1_1_35b9930ca897512a4d00b43d26eac73d on the shell server

<details>
  <summary>Hints</summary>
  
    1. grep tutorial [2] (grep man page)
</details>

## Solution

The title of the challenge suggests grepping the flag, from the file provided, ive used Notepad++ for it, and searching for the flag structure:

----

# net cat

Using netcat (nc) will be a necessity throughout your adventure. Can you connect to 2018shell1.picoctf.com at port 22847 to get the flag?

<details>
  <summary>Hints</summary>
  
    1. nc tutorial  
</details>

## Solution

Using netcat we connect to the supplied address and receive the flag.

# Strings

Can you find the flag in this [file1](https://github.com/bear-sec/pico2018/blob/master/Hideout/7%20-%20strings/strings?raw=true)  without actually running it? You can also find the file in /problems/strings_0_bf57524acf558aca2081eb97ece8e2ee on the shell server.

<details>
  <summary>Hints</summary>
  
    1. strings (strings man page) 
</details>

## Solution

The challenge suggests to use strings command but again, searching in Notepad++ gives the result as well.

# Pipe

During your adventure, you will likely encounter a situation where you need to process data that you receive over the network rather than through a file. Can you find a way to save the output from this program and search for the flag? Connect with 2018shell1.picoctf.com 48696.

<details>
  <summary>Hints</summary>
  
    1. Remember the flag format is picoCTF{% raw %}{XXXX}{% endraw %} (2) Ever heard of a pipe? No not that kind of pipe... <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/pipe.2.html">This kind</a>
</details>

## Solution

The challenge name suggest you need to pipe the output after connecting with netcat and searching for the flag. 
As you can see ive tried connecting without piping the output before running the command.

# grep2

This one is a little bit harder. Can you find the flag in /problems/grep-2_4_06c2058761f24267033e7ca6ff9d9144/files on the shell server? Remember, grep is your friend.

<details>
  <summary>Hints</summary>
  
    1. grep tutorial [2] (grep man page)
</details>

## Solution

They dont provide the flag file but they do send you to a folder on the challenges server. 
In that directory we have a folder named files
and in the folder there are some folders, with each one containing some files.
![files](https://bear-sec.github.io/images/hideout-grep2_1.PNG)
This instantly means we need to somehow find the flag in all of the files, and of course not file by file.
This means we need to RTFM of the suggested command 'grep':

> -R, -r, --recursive
> Read all  files  under  each  directory,  recursively;  this  is
> equivalent to the -d recurse option."

so we try in our shell and get the flag:

# Aca-Shell-A

It's never a bad idea to brush up on those linux skills or even learn some new ones before you set off on this adventure! Connect with nc 2018shell1.picoctf.com 58422.

<details>
  <summary>Hints</summary>
  
    1. <a href="https://maker.pro/linux/tutorial/basic-linux-commands-for-beginners">Linux for Beginners</a>
</details>

## Solution

In this challenge we use netcat to connect to some sort of a restricted shell since many of the linux commands are just not recognized. 
We get a greeting message that explains us that someone is working with us, so we will just look around.
Running ls gives the folders where we are in the moment. 
secret look interesting, so we cd to it and the voice with us tells us to remove the intel files, so we follow it. The voice says he dropped us an exploit, which we can run.
![acashella](https://bear-sec.github.io/images/hideout-acashella_22.png)
The voice asks us to show the username were on, and copy a file from the tmp directory and read it.
This prints the flag.
