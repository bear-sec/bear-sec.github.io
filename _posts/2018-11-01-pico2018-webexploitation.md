title: PicoCTF 2018 - Web Exploitation
---

This post will be focusing on the "Web Exploitation" challenges presented in picoCTF. Im not the expert on web exploitation, and really enjoy when things just work out, which happened here, and all of the challenges were solved except one.
All the resources for these challenges, including most of the files, you can find in [my repository](https://github.com/bear-sec/pico2018 "picoCTF2018 writeups").

    1. How do you inspect a website's code on a browser? <br>
    2. Check all the website code.

## Solution

Inspecting the page source we get the first part of the flag, and a hint that there are two more parts.

We inspect the only two included files with this site, which are the CSS and JS files, and see the rest of the flag.
