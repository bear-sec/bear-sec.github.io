title: PicoCTF 2018 - Hideout
---

This post will be focusing on the "Hideout" challenges presented in picoCTF. These challenges were classified as "General skills". 
All the resources for these challenges, including most of the files, you can find in [my repository](https://github.com/bear-sec/pico2018 "picoCTF2018 writeups").
Lets get in the action.

# General Warmup 1

If I told you your grade was 0x41 in hexadecimal, what would it be in ASCII?

<details>
  <summary>Hints</summary>
  
    1. Submit your answer in our competition's flag format. For example, if you answer was 'hello', you would submit {% raw %}'picoCTF{hello}'{% endraw %} as the flag.
</details>

## Solution

Easy one, basic hexadecimal-to-ascii conversion. 
python:
```python
  print {% raw %}"picoCTF{%c}"{% endraw %} % 0x41
```
----

# General Warmup 2

Can you convert the number 27 (base 10) to binary (base 2)? 

<details>
  <summary>Hints</summary>
  
    1. Submit your answer in our competition's flag format. For example, if you answer was '11111', you would submit {% raw %}'picoCTF{11111}'{% endraw %} as the flag.
</details>

## Solution

Simple base conversion:
python:
```python
  print {% raw %}"picoCTF{%s}"{% endraw %} % bin(27)[2:]
```
----

# General Warmup 3

What is 0x3D (base 16) in decimal (base 10).

<details>
  <summary>Hints</summary>
  
    1. Submit your answer in our competition's flag format. For example, if you answer was '22', you would submit {% raw %}'picoCTF{22}'{% endraw %} as the flag.
</details>

## Solution

Simple base conversion again:
python:
```python
  print {% raw %}"picoCTF{%d}"{% endraw %} % 0x3d
```

# Resources

We put together a bunch of resources to help you out on our website! If you go over there, you might even find a flag! https://picoctf.com/resources

## Solution

No hints for this one, but we dont need them anyway, cause we just scroll down the page, and see the flag:
picoCTF{xiexie_ni_lai_zheli}

----

# grep1

Can you find the flag in [file 1](https://github.com/bear-sec/pico2018/blob/master/Hideout/5%20-%20grep1/file "File1") ? This would be really obnoxious to look through by hand, see if you can find a faster way. You can also find the file in /problems/grep-1_1_35b9930ca897512a4d00b43d26eac73d on the shell server

<details>
  <summary>Hints</summary>
  
    1. grep tutorial [2] (grep man page)
</details>

## Solution

The title of the challenge suggests grepping the flag, from the file provided, ive used Notepad++ for it, and searching for the flag structure:
![image](https://bear-sec.github.io/images/hideout-grep1_1.PNG)

----

# net cat

Using netcat (nc) will be a necessity throughout your adventure. Can you connect to 2018shell1.picoctf.com at port 22847 to get the flag?

<details>
  <summary>Hints</summary>
  
    1. nc tutorial  
</details>

## Solution

Using netcat we connect to the supplied address and receive the flag.

---

# Strings

Can you find the flag in this [file1](https://github.com/bear-sec/pico2018/blob/master/Hideout/7%20-%20strings/strings?raw=true)  without actually running it? You can also find the file in /problems/strings_0_bf57524acf558aca2081eb97ece8e2ee on the shell server.

<details>
  <summary>Hints</summary>
  
    1. strings (strings man page) 
</details>

## Solution

The challenge suggests to use strings command but again, searching in Notepad++ gives the result as well.
![strings?](https://bear-sec.github.io/images/hideout-strings_1.PNG)

----

# Pipe

During your adventure, you will likely encounter a situation where you need to process data that you receive over the network rather than through a file. Can you find a way to save the output from this program and search for the flag? Connect with 2018shell1.picoctf.com 48696.

<details>
  <summary>Hints</summary>
  
    1. Remember the flag format is picoCTF{% raw %}{XXXX}{% endraw %} (2) Ever heard of a pipe? No not that kind of pipe... <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/pipe.2.html">This kind</a>
</details>

## Solution

The challenge name suggest you need to pipe the output after connecting with netcat and searching for the flag. 
As you can see ive tried connecting without piping the output before running the command.
![pipes](https://bear-sec.github.io/images/hideout-pipe_1.PNG)

----

# grep2

This one is a little bit harder. Can you find the flag in /problems/grep-2_4_06c2058761f24267033e7ca6ff9d9144/files on the shell server? Remember, grep is your friend.

<details>
  <summary>Hints</summary>
  
    1. grep tutorial [2] (grep man page)
</details>

## Solution

They dont provide the flag file but they do send you to a folder on the challenges server. 
In that directory we have a folder named files
and in the folder there are some folders, with each one containing some files.
![files](https://bear-sec.github.io/images/hideout-grep2_1.PNG)
This instantly means we need to somehow find the flag in all of the files, and of course not file by file.
This means we need to RTFM of the suggested command 'grep':

> -R, -r, --recursive
> Read all  files  under  each  directory,  recursively;  this  is
> equivalent to the -d recurse option."

so we try in our shell and get the flag:

# Aca-Shell-A

It's never a bad idea to brush up on those linux skills or even learn some new ones before you set off on this adventure! Connect with nc 2018shell1.picoctf.com 58422.

<details>
  <summary>Hints</summary>
  
    1. <a href="https://maker.pro/linux/tutorial/basic-linux-commands-for-beginners">Linux for Beginners</a>
</details>

## Solution

In this challenge we use netcat to connect to some sort of a restricted shell since many of the linux commands are just not recognized. 
We get a greeting message that explains us that someone is working with us, so we will just look around.
Running ls gives the folders where we are in the moment. 
secret look interesting, so we cd to it and the voice with us tells us to remove the intel files, so we follow it. The voice says he dropped us an exploit, which we can run.
![acashella](https://bear-sec.github.io/images/hideout-acashella_22.png)
The voice asks us to show the username were on, and copy a file from the tmp directory and read it.
This prints the flag.

# Environ

Sometimes you have to configure environment variables before executing a program. Can you find the flag we've hidden in an environment variable on the shell server?

<details>
  <summary>Hints</summary>
  
    1. unix <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/env">env</a>
</details>

## Solution

Not much to this one, just running env in the competition shell and grepping the flag format yields the answer.
![env](https://bear-sec.github.io/images/hideout-environ_1.PNG)

# SSH-Keyz

As nice as it is to use our webshell, sometimes its helpful to connect directly to our machine. To do so, please add your own public key to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys, using the webshell. The flag is in the ssh banner which will be displayed when you login remotely with ssh to  with your username.

<details>
  <summary>Hints</summary>
  
    1. key generation tutorial[1] We also have an expert demonstrator to help you along. link[2] (something they recorded)
</details>

## Solution

Generating the ssh key pair, and copying the public key through the web shell solves this challenge, and you can see that you get the flag each time you login via ssh.

# What base is this

To be successful on your mission, you must be able read data represented in different ways, such as hexadecimal or binary. Can you get the flag from this program to prove you are ready? Connect with nc 2018shell1.picoctf.com 31711.

<details>
  <summary>Hints</summary>
  
    1. I hear python is a good means (among many) to convert things. <br>
    2. It might help to have multiple windows open
</details>

## Solution

We connect to the supplied port and were greeted with a message explaining the challenge. We need to convert numbers in some unknown base to ascii word and supply it back to the socket. For the sake of this challenge ive created a script that waits my input, (which will be the numbers) and returns each time the output from the relevant function for that stage.

```python
import binascii

def bloop1(a):
    b = [chr(int(x,2)) for x in a.split(' ')]
    print ''.join(b)

def bloop2(a):
    print binascii.unhexlify(a)
    
def bloop3(a):
	b = [chr(int(x,8)) for x in a.split(' ')]
	print b

thing = raw_input()
print bloop1(thing)
thing = raw_input()
print bloop2(thing)
thing = raw_input()
print bloop3(thing)
```

# You Cant See Me

'...reading transmission... Y.O.U. .C.A.N.'.T. .S.E.E. .M.E.  ...transmission ended...' Maybe something lies in /problems/you-can-t-see-me_3_1a39ec6c80b3f3a18610074f68acfe69.

<details>
  <summary>Hints</summary>
  
    1. What command can see/read files? <br>
    2. What's in the manual page of ls?
</details>

## Solution

In this challenge, as soon as we ls the challenge directory, we see that theres a file there with the name "." so we resort to the manpage of ls as suggested and see that theres this option:

>-Q, --quote-name
>   enclose entry names in double quotes

Which runnig gives us that the file name is actually ".  ", and we can simply 'cat' is.

# Absolutely Relative

In a filesystem, everything is relative ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. Can you find a way to get a flag from [this program](https://github.com/bear-sec/pico2018/blob/master/Hideout/15%20-%20absolutely%20relative/absolutely-relative?raw=true) ? You can find it in /problems/absolutely-relative_2_69862edfe341b57b6ed2c62c7107daee on the shell server. [Source](https://github.com/bear-sec/pico2018/raw/master/Hideout/15%20-%20absolutely%20relative/absolutely-relative.c)

<details>
  <summary>Hints</summary>
  
    1. Do you have to run the program in the same directory? (⊙.☉)7 <br>
    2. Ever used a text editor? Check out the program 'nano'
</details>

## Solution

We download the supplied files, an ELF executable file, and his source code. Lets try and understand what the program does. Running the program gives us the message "You do not have sufficient permissions to view the flag.", which we can see in the source in line 33.
line 31 supposed to give us the "good boy" message with the flag, lets see what do we need to do to get there.
In the if caluse, theres a string comparrison between 'permission' and 'yes' variable. We can see that 'yes' is a char const of "yes" and 'permission' is a local variable defined in line 10, and read into with scanf in line 24. 
We can see that the file opened is "./permission.txt" which reffers to a file in current directory, which we dont have control over, but if we create a file with the same name in our home dir, we can run the program and pass the check. 

# In-out-Error

Can you utlize stdin, stdout, and stderr to get the flag from this [program](https://github.com/bear-sec/pico2018/blob/master/Hideout/16%20-%20in%20out%20error/in-out-error?raw=true) ? You can also find it in /problems/in-out-error_4_c51f68457d8543c835331292b7f332d2 on the shell server

<details>
  <summary>Hints</summary>
  
    1. Maybe you can split the stdout and stderr output?
</details>

## Solution

The challenge says that we need to utilize the stdin, out, and err, so we run and see what we get.
![mishmash](https://bear-sec.github.io/images/hideout-inouterr_1.PNG)
We get a lot of output, that looks like its a couple of texts mixed together with the flag. Printing just the stdout by redirecting stderr to /dev/null, we get the lyrics of an great song. Redirecting stdout to /dev/null we get the flag a bunch of times.

# Learn GDB

Using a debugging tool will be extremely useful on your missions. Can you run this [program](https://github.com/bear-sec/pico2018/blob/master/Hideout/17%20-%20learn%20gdb/run?raw=true)  in gdb and find the flag? You can find the file in /problems/learn-gdb_2_32e08c18932eb88649e9b97f3020b9f5 on the shell server.


<details>
  <summary>Hints</summary>
  
    1. Try setting breakpoints in gdb <br>
    2. Try and find a point in the program after the flag has been read into memory to break on <br>
    3. Where is the flag being written in memory?
</details>

## Solution

We get a file and an instruction to learn gdb. Were in luck cause we learned GDB before and we can jump right into the action. so we run gdb, and start investimagating the ELF.
First thing forst is just running it which prints that the program is decrypting the flag into 'flag_buf' global variable, this can be useful info later on. 
lets run info func, and see what functions we have in the file. 
![main_info](https://bear-sec.github.io/images/hideout-gdb_1.PNG)
Now jump into main to get a feel for the calling order.
![main_main](https://bear-sec.github.io/images/hideout-gdb_2.PNG)
Without getting into the functions themselves, we see that the executable calls setv, puts, decrypt_flag, and puts. 
So somewhere between the first and the second puts, we have the flag decrypted, we peek inside the decrypt_flag function. We see that theres a variable called flag_buf. Lets see where we can put a breakpoint to see whats inside flag_buf.
Im definig a breakpoint right after decrypt_flag and see if the flag_buf is populated with the flag, and indeed it is.

# Roulette

This Online [Roulette](https://github.com/bear-sec/pico2018/blob/master/Hideout/18%20-%20roulette/roulette?raw=true)  Service is in Beta. Can you find a way to win $1,000,000,000 and get the flag? [Source](https://github.com/bear-sec/pico2018/raw/master/Hideout/18%20-%20roulette/roulette.c) . Connect with nc 2018shell1.picoctf.com 25443

    1. There are 2 bugs!
</details>

## Solution

in this roulette game we need to win a billion dollars to get the flag. so of course we wont be playing the roulette until we win this amount legitimately, and the challenge suggests that there are 2 bugs in the code. We get thesource code so we wont be shooting in the dark. 
in these sorts of challenges the first go-to bug to check is wether of not i can bet more than i have, by supplying a huge number that will be compared and interpreted as a signed negative number, and pass the check at line 56:

```c
long get_bet() {
  while(1) {
    puts("How much will you wager?");
    printf("Current Balance: $%lu \t Current Wins: %lu\n", cash, wins); 
    long bet = get_long(); 
    if(bet <= cash) {
      return bet;
    } else {
      puts("You can't bet more than you have!");
    }
  }
}
```

in get_bet function. and indeed its vulnerable. 
![vulnerable_indeed](https://bear-sec.github.io/images/hideout-roulette_1.png)
We see that in the C source the variable 'bet' is of type long which means its signed, and the compiler will treat it as one in conditional jumps. We can of course check if its true and supply such a number, and we can see that if overflows, and lets us win a lot of cash. Ok now we know it has trouble handling numbers, lets try betting a negative number so it could remove this number from our initial cash and x-(-y) = x+y, so we will actually win, and we can get the 1 billion dollars quick and easy. but no, it says that we are cheaters (no argue about that) and throws us away saying that were not on a streak. 
![cheaters](https://bear-sec.github.io/images/hideout-roulette_2.png)
Lets go back to the code and find the second bug. Since the code only has the input of a bet, and a choice, lets check that the choice is handled correctly, or the "random number" of the roulette. Lets look at the how the number is generated, and maybe we can predict it. 
From main, we get_bet(), and rigt after we get_choice(), which checks well that its a number between 1, and 36. Lets continue to play_roulette. 
so first we see a call to rand(), aha, well lets see if theres a previous call to srand, and if not we know the seed and can predict its values and know the outcome of spinning the roulette. so we search of srand in the source and see that in line 52, theres a call to it with a positive number not greater than 5000:

```c
long get_rand() {
  long seed;
  FILE *f = fopen("/dev/urandom", "r");
  fread(&seed, sizeof(seed), 1, f);
  fclose(f);
  seed = seed % 5000;
  if (seed < 0) seed = seed * -1;
  srand(seed);
  return seed;
}
```

so now we can easily predict the outcome of a few roulette spins by just generating the first, lets say, 10 numbers from each seed 0-5000 and when we actually spin it we can know to what series the of random numbers we belong, but wait! the seed is returned here, so lets see where is it used. damn! line 185, in main the cash we get in the beginnig of the game is the seed, easy!

```c
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  setvbuf(stdout, NULL, _IONBF, 0);

  cash = get_rand();
  
  puts("Welcome to ONLINE ROULETTE!");
  printf("Here, have $%ld to start on the house! You'll lose it all anyways >:)\n", cash);
  puts("");
```

all we need to do is calculate a few numbers to know which consecutive ones will come to bet on them. 
and finally with the first bug, we can win an arbitrary large amount of money.
just running rand() 3 times wont work too, cause if we see colsely in the code, between roulette spins, if the choice correct, it calls rand() again to get a random congratulations message:

```c
  if (spin == choice) {
    cash += 2*bet;
    puts(win_msgs[rand()%NUM_WIN_MSGS]);
    wins += 1;
  }
```

so we need to get the 1st, 3rd and 5th values. Now that we have our streak, we can get the 7th value of rand and supply our bet as MAX_INT-ONE_BILLION and we get the flag.
